# W20-W22: copy engines, HTC and WMI init to WMI READY (WCN7850, `fuxiwlanqrtr=6`, C1)

Status: host-tested only (tools/test-fuxi-wlan-ce.py). Nothing here has run on a device. Every line below
that says what the target does is what the model does, built from Linux ath12k v6.19.

After this boot's W15 WLAN_MODE reply, the radio lane programs the host side of copy engines CE0..CE4 on
SRNG rings, posts RX buffers, completes HTC (READY, HTT and WMI connect, SETUP_COMPLETE_EX) and WMI init
(SERVICE_READY, SERVICE_AVAILABLE, EXT, EXT2, INIT with the WCN7850 resource config, READY, HW mode DBS),
all by polling, then stops and contains as every run does (wl5_abort). No interrupt, MSI or GIC
programming, no pdev parameter, no vdev, no RF activity; nothing is transmitted on the air.

Code: `xnu/fuxi-wlan/fuxi_wlan_ce.h` (pure ring/HTC/WMI code, lands as `bsd/dev/fuxi_wlan_ce.h`, carries
the Clear BSD notice and the L19 file list) and the block `/* ---- W20: ... ---- */` in
`xnu/fuxi-wlan/fuxi_wlan.c` (kernel glue). Patch 0099 carries both (the header as its own new-file hunk
after `fuxi_wlan.c`, before `wlan.c`).

L19 = Linux ath12k v6.19 (05f7e89ab), `drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath12k`, BSD-3-Clause-Clear. Every
file:line below is into that tree. UniXNU-sheng was not used for any line of code.

## Knobs and gating

| Knob | Values | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `fuxiwlanqrtr=6` | | W11..W15 as `=5`, then W20..W22. Needs all 28 steps (`fuxiwlan=1` or `28`); refused with `fuxiwlankeep=1` or `fuxiwlanstop22=1`. The W15 knobs (`fuxiwlanw15`, `fuxiwlanw16`) apply. |
| `fuxiwlanqrtr` outside 0..6 | 7, 8 (C2/C3), negative, 9+ | refused (`W20 fuxiwlanqrtr=N is not 0..6 in this build; refused`). Before C1 these ran silently with no QRTR. |
| `fuxiwlanw20=N` | 0 default | 0x01 NOHTT (no HTT connect; WMI then gets the next endpoint), 0x04 MRRS128 (endpoint PCIe Device Control max read request 128 bytes before CE init, low half only), 0x40 NOHWMODE (no PDEV_SET_HW_MODE). Only with qrtr 6. Every other bit is refused: 0x02 HTTVER, 0x10 BAND24, 0x20 FULLBSSID, 0x80 PDEV0 belong to C2, 0x08 ACTIVE transmits. |

Refusals set `wl_variant_invalid`; salami refuses at init before any access, the Fuxi build at step 17.
Every boot without `fuxiwlanqrtr=6` logs and behaves as before C1 (checked by test-fuxi-wlan-salami.py
and all W10..W17 suites). For C2: raise `WL20_QRTR_MAX` and `WL20_BITS`, add the scan stage after
`wl_w22_run`, and the STOP_SCAN in `wl_ce_contain` before its stopping latch (the latch refuses every
send): one bounded send and a short TX drain whose failure never fails the abort.

## Sequence (L19 core.c:1274-1300, 868-960)

1. W15 MODE reply; with qrtr 6 the MODE line ends `; CE/HTC next` and the observation is 200 ms (not 2000).
2. `wl_w20_run` (stage W20): optional MRRS128; the arena (512 KiB, aligned to its size, Normal-NC, mapped
   leaf by leaf with live SMMU readback by `wl12_map_target`); seven rings in L19 order (ce.c:912-971) with
   readback of BASE_LSB and MISC; HTC init; 62 + 62 RX buffers; HTC READY (3000 ms; L19 waits 1 s,
   services the CEs and waits 1 s more, htc.c:491-515).
3. `wl_w21_run` (stage W21): connect HTT (unless 0x01) then WMI, SETUP_COMPLETE_EX, SERVICE_READY (5000 ms),
   SERVICE_AVAILABLE (optional, up to 1000 ms), SERVICE_READY_EXT (5000 ms, always: L19 completes service
   ready only from EXT or EXT2, wmi.c:4940-4941, 5645), EXT2 when service 220 is set (5000 ms).
   `num_mem_reqs != 0` stops the run (a plan rule, overnight_plan.md 4.4; the failure line says "plan rule,
   not L19"): L19 never reads it and never hands memory chunks to INIT (wmi.c:4230, 4077-4083).
4. `wl_w22_run` (stage W22): INIT, READY (5000 ms; its status is logged, not acted on, as L19 wmi.c:6910),
   HW mode DBS (unless 0x40),
   500 ms of polling for the HW mode response and unprompted events, then stop.
5. Containment: `wl_ce_contain` is the first step of `wl5_abort`; it latches "stopping" (no post, send,
   consumption or publish after it). The arena is freed with the other DMA buffers only when MHI reset,
   bus master off, PERST and the SMMU undo are proven; otherwise it is quarantined until reboot.

Poll pass (`wl_ce_poll`): `wl_w11_events` (MHI events, QMI indications, the AMSS/M0/SMMU guard), RX on
CE2 then CE1 (one HTC handler for both, as ce.c:154-170), TX completions on CE0/CE3, `wl_w11_guard`.
1 ms steps while a reply is due, 10 ms while observing. One HTC message in flight at a time (TX drain
after each send, as W11 does). WMI commands wait up to 3000 ms for HTC credits (wmi.c:435-456).

Unprompted events may come before or after `hw mode dbs sent`. The `W15 complete` line is not printed
with qrtr 6 (W22 prints its own).

Failure lines: `W20|W21|W22 timeout <stage> (<ms> ms); contain, no retry` or `W2x <step> FAILED: <reason>`,
then the snapshot (`W20 snapshot <stage>: ...`, one line per ring with host HP/TP next to its rdp word, TX
and RX counts, HTC credits per endpoint, the last WMI event, then the six-read WLFW diagnostic), then
`W2x failure: <reason>; contain, no retry` and the normal abort lines. Reasons are the string literals of
the header (`CE STATUS length 0 or above the RX buffer`, `HTC trailer length outside 4..payload`, ...).
The failure ladders are overnight_plan.md section 3.4.

| Free entry | next HP != device TP | hal.c:2063-2094 |
| Barriers | read barrier after a device pointer (dma_rmb), write barrier before a pointer publish (MMIO wmb; mb() before a STATUS TP) | hal.c:2144-2164, 2169-2219 |

Differences from L19, all deliberate:
- No MSI address and no interrupt thresholds: CONS_IX0/IX1 and PRODUCER_INT_SETUP are written 0. L19
  writes batch 1 / timer / low-threshold values for CEs without DIS_INTR (ce.c:578-614, hal.c:1676-1685,
  1752-1769); with no MSI enable those only shape interrupts [I]. If the device never moves an rdp word
  this is the first difference to look at.
- Barriers are `dsb sy` on both sides: at least as strong as L19's dma_rmb and its mb() before a STATUS TP
  (the plan's `dsb ld`/`dsb st` would be weaker than L19 for that TP).
- STATUS length 0 or above 2048, a STATUS pointer beyond the posted buffers, a TX TP that passes the HP
  or moves back, an HTC message on an unconnected endpoint, a trailer record longer than the trailer, and
  malformed TLVs stop the run; L19 warns and drops most of them. A STATUS pointer that moves back k
  entries reads as a forward move of (entries - k): the posted-buffer bound stops it only when that
  exceeds the buffers out (on CE2 only k = 1), otherwise it stops as `CE STATUS length 0` at the first
  entry, already consumed (length cleared) or never written.
- DEST_CTRL is read back after its write (L19 does not): it is the only bound on what the engine writes
  into one 2 KiB RX buffer, so a value that did not take stops the run before any buffer is posted.
- 62 RX buffers per pipe instead of nentries - 2 (ce.c:948-949); the device takes what is posted.

Corrections to the plan's `[I]` items, found in L19:
- `rx_batchmode` is set to 1 by `ath12k_wmi_init_wcn7850` (hw.h:64) but `ath12k_wmi_copy_resource_config`
  never copies it, so it is 0 on the wire. `vow_config` (TARGET_VOW_CONFIG 0, hw.h:58), `atf_config`, `twt`
  and `ema` are copied (wmi.c:3974, 3999-4005, 4013-4014) but are 0 for WCN7850. The wire list of the plan
  is right; the test checks all 73 words against L19.
- EXT is awaited whether or not service 77 is set (L19 has no completion without it).
- The INIT, READY, SERVICE_READY and SERVICE_AVAILABLE sizes and word offsets, the R0 offsets and the
  service bit numbers are now `[V]` from L19 (previously from L66).
- A failed `num_mem_reqs != 0` stop is our rule, not L19's (L19 never reads it). The WMI READY status is
  only logged: L19 stores it (wmi.c:6910) and never acts on it.

## Host tests

`CC=cc python3 tools/test-fuxi-wlan-ce.py` (also in tools/ci/build.sh): the model in
tools/fuxi-wlan-ce-model.c runs the production glue and header under ASan/UBSan with -Wall -Wextra
-Werror. It owns a BAR0 model (window register with readback, shadow registers routed through the same
`wl15_shadow_v3` table, its own list of CE registers, DEST_CTRL pinned to 2048 and written only after its
ring is enabled; any other access aborts), a DMA map of the arena only (each RX message inside its own
2 KiB buffer), a CE engine (descriptor, slot and buffer checks, DST word 1 = address bits 39:32 only,
rdp writes) and a fake firmware with its own credit ledger (header included) that checks INIT and HW
mode field by field and that INIT comes only after EXT/EXT2 reached the host. Scenarios: happy path with
shadow registers and with `fuxiwlanw15=1` (R2 through the window), services 256.. read only from the
4-word array; w20 0x45; credit exhaustion with a trailer-only refund, credit starvation (3 s timeout), u8
credit allocation, credit size 336 (the INIT frame costs 2 with its header); no HTC READY with proven
and unproven containment (arena freed only when proven); STATUS length 0 and 2049; endpoint 9;
unconnected endpoint; long trailer; trailer length 0; HTC payload longer than the CE transfer; TLV past
the buffer; nested overrun; rdp outside the ring, beyond the posted buffers and misaligned; CE2 STATUS
pointer back 1 entry (posted-buffer bound) and back 2 (zero length); TX TP backwards; mem-reqs;
connect refused and connect to endpoint 0; a guard failure; tolerated credit report for endpoint 12, no
EXT2 service, HTC READY on CE1, empty HTC messages on EP0 and the WMI endpoint, READY status 3, READY
with a MAC (bytes 24..29, non-zero ABI words before it), a 2048-byte transfer; EXT 1500 ms late with and
without EXT2; window readback mismatch on select and on restore (no later CE write); a fault latched
after the 5th CE write (no later write); a DEST_CTRL that does not take (no RX buffer posted); after
`wl_ce_contain` no register write, publish, send, RX post or reap; the RX post bound on a fresh layout
and the shadow writer's bounds; ring wrap (140 commands through 32-entry CE3, 148 events through 64-entry
CE2); every rdp load followed by the read barrier and every publish preceded by the write barrier. With
the L19 tree on disk it also re-derives the ids, tags, sizes, all INIT words, the HTC constants and the
CE geometry; on CI (no tree) that part prints SKIPPED.

What only the device can answer: whether the firmware fetches from the rings at all with zero interrupt
thresholds, which pipe carries HTC READY (both are polled), the credit numbers, the real pdev id, whether
`num_mem_reqs` is 0, and whether WMI READY comes back. Not written yet: the type-1 segment compare helper
of overnight_plan.md 4.11 (the layout of the firmware's copy in that segment is not known).
